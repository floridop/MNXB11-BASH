# Instructions

1. `cd` into the exercise folder `ex4.N` where `N` is the number of the exercise
2. perform the requested tasks
3. Check the expected output with `cat output`
4. Try to write the code or run the script so that it outputs the same as the output
5. If you do not manage check the solution in `solution/`

For exercises that require commands, the solution can be inspected with
`cat solution/commands_to_run`

You may want to open multiple terminals, one to check the solution, one to run the command.
